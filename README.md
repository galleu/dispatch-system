# Open Source Dispatch System
This CAD (Computer-Aided Dispatch System) is a open source system for anyone to use. This is for a game only, and should never be used for any other purpose. This integrates with discord, and is designed to be used with console/non PC integrated games.

Feel free to help out and make this project event better.
